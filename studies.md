# Self Studies

## Brief

In this lesson, we will be learning about event streaming and stream processing. We will learn how to consume messages from Kafka and use Spark to process streaming data.

We will be running Kafka and Spark on Google Colabatory (Colab). As both Kafka and Spark are distributed frameworks which run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it requires a Java runtime environment to run. Colab comes with a Java runtime environment pre-installed, so we can run Kafka and Spark on Colab without any additional setup.
