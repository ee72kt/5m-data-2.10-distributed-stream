# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation and Lesson Overview

We will be using Google Colaboratory (you can use the same google account created in the previous unit) in this lesson.

We will be running Kafka and Spark on Colab. As both Kafka and Spark are distributed frameworks which run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it requires a Java runtime environment to run. Colab comes with a Java runtime environment pre-installed, so we can run Kafka and Spark on Colab without any additional setup.

## Part 2 - Hands-on with Kafka

We will be using [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WwwGa-tVIqr2aNLPrxqFqFyQAwrxU1JD?usp=sharing) Colab notebook for this section.

> Open the Colab link, then go to File -> Save a copy in Drive. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive. It will then open the notebook in a new tab.
